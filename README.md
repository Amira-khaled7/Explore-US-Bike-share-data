# Explore-US-Bike-share-data
This project is part of Udacity course of Data Analysis Nano Degree program.
## Introduction
In this project, I used Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington.
I wrote code to import the data and answer the questions about it by computing descriptive statistics, 
I also wrote a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal.
